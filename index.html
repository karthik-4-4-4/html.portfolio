            <p  class="indent">Population growth is the increase in the number of people in a population or dispersed group. Actual
                global human population growth amounts to around 83 million annually, or 1.1% per year.The global
                population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.9 billion in 2020.The UN projected population to
                keep growing, and estimates have put the total population at 8.6 billion by mid-2030, 9.8 billion by
                mid-2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.However, some academics outside the UN have increasingly developed
                human population models that account for additional downward pressures on population growth; in such
                a
                scenario population would peak before 2100.Others have challenged many recent population projections
                as having underestimated population growth.<br><br>

                World human population has been growing since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350.A mix
                of technological advancement that improved agricultural productivity and sanitation and medical
                advancement that reduced mortality increased population growth. In some geographies, this has slowed
                through the process called the demographic transition, where many nations with high standards of
                living
                have seen a significant slowing of population growth. This is in direct contrast with less developed
                contexts, where population growth is still happening. Globally, the rate of population growth has
                declined from a peak of 2.2% per year in 1963. The global human population is projected to peak
                during the mid-21st century and decline by 2100.
            </p><br>

            Population growth alongside increased consumption is a driver of environmental concerns, such as
            biodiversity loss and climate change, due to overexploitation of natural resources for human
            development. International policy focused on mitigating the impact of human population growth is
            concentrated in the Sustainable Development Goals which seek to improve the standard of living globally
            while reducing the impact of society on the environment while advancing human well-being.

                    <h2>Factors influencing Population Growth</h2>
                </u>

                <p  class="indent">When demographers attempt to forecast changes in the size of a population, they typically focus on
                    four

                    main factors: fertility rates, mortality rates (life expectancy), the initial age profile of the
                    population (whether it is relatively old or relatively young to begin with) and migration. In the
                    case

                    of religious groups, a fifth factor is switching – how many people choose to enter and leave each
                    group,
                    including how many become unaffiliated with any religion.However their are also other factors like
                    birth rate, death rate, Government policies and Economic development which influence population
                    growth. <br>

                    In this we can overview of each of these four main drivers of population change. It
                    highlights
                    important trends, discusses key assumptions about the future and acknowledges weak spots in the
                    demographic data currently available on some countries and religious groups.<br>

                    In some cases, this chapter also shows how different the projections would be if particular factors,
                    such as migration, were not taken into account. These hypothetical scenarios are intended to give
                    readers a sense of how much impact various factors have on the projections.</p>

                <p  class="indent">Total Fertility Worldwide, 1950-2050
                    Over the last half century, the global fertility rate has fallen sharply. In the 1950 to 1955
                    period,
                    the average woman was expected to have about five children over the course of her lifetime. By
                    2010-2015, the global average was about 2.5 children per woman.15 According to the United Nations
                    Population Division, worldwide fertility rates are expected to continue to drop in the decades to
                    come,
                    gradually moving toward 2.1 children per woman, which is traditionally viewed as the “replacement
                    level”
                    needed to maintain a stable population in countries with low mortality rates among the young.</p>
                <br>

                <p>As a result of declining fertility rates, global population growth is slowing. Over the four decades
                    from 1970 to 2010, the number of people on Earth grew nearly 90%. From 2010 to 2050, the world’s
                    population is expected to rise 35%, from roughly 7 billion to more than 9 billion.</p><br>

                <p>Among the world’s major religious groups, Muslims have the highest Total Fertility Rate as of
                    2010-2015,
                    a global average of 3.1 children per woman. This is one of the main reasons why the Muslim
                    population is
                    expected to grow not only in absolute numbers but also in relative terms – as a percentage of all
                    the
                    people in the world – in the decades to come.</p><br>

                <p>Christians (2.7 children per woman) are the only other major religious group whose Total Fertility
                    Rate,
                    on a worldwide basis, exceeds the average for all women (2.5), during the present five-year period
                    (2010-2015).</p><br>

                <p>Globally, fertility among Hindus (2.4 children per woman) and Jews (2.3) is above the replacement
                    level
                    (2.1 children). Fertility rates among all the other groups – followers of folk religions (1.8),
                    other
                    religions as a whole (1.7), the religiously unaffiliated (1.7) and Buddhists (1.6) – are below the
                    replacement level, meaning the groups are not bearing enough children to maintain their current
                    populations, all else remaining equal.</p><br>

                <p>One of the assumptions behind the U.N.’s global population forecasts, as well as the Pew Research
                    projections, is that over time fertility rates generally converge toward the replacement level.17 If
                    they start above the replacement level, they tend to decline. If they start below the replacement
                    level,
                    they tend to rise – although they may change slowly and may not actually reach the replacement level
                    in
                    the coming decades.</p><br>


                <h2>2.Life Expectancy</h2>
                <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7e/3d/06/7e3d06102282a75e63b4eef7e6488427.jpg " height="400px" class="float">
                <p  class="indent">Life expectancy at birth – an estimate of the expected life span of an average newborn child – has
                    been rising around the world. According to the United Nations, global life expectancy at birth
                    increased from 48 years in the 1950 to 1955 period to 69 years in 2010-2015, and it is expected to
                    continue to rise over the next four decades.

                    People in many (though not all) countries are living longer due to increased access to healthcare,
                    improvements in diet and hygiene, effective responses to infectious disease, and many other factors.
                </p><br>

                <p>These developments in healthcare and living conditions, however, have not occurred uniformly around
                    the world. As a result, life expectancy varies across the six regions in this study. At present,
                    North America has the highest average life expectancy (79 years), followed closely by Europe (77)
                    and Latin America and the Caribbean (75). Average life expectancies in the Middle East and North
                    Africa (72) and the Asia-Pacific region (70) are slightly above the global average (69). Sub-Saharan
                    Africa is the only region where average life expectancy (55 years) is below the global average.</p>
                <br>

                <p>By 2050, life expectancy at birth is projected to average 76 years around the world, an increase of
                    about seven years from the current five-year period (2010-2015). All six geographic regions are
                    expected to see a rise in their populations’ life expectancy over the coming decades. But regions
                    and individual countries that have relatively high life expectancies in 2010-2015 are expected to
                    make only modest gains compared with regions and individual countries where life expectancy, at
                    present, is much lower. For example, North America is expected to see a five-year gain in life
                    expectancy by 2050 – from 79 to 84 years. Sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, is projected to experience
                    an increase in average life expectancy of 13 years, from 55 to 68 years.</p><br>

                <p>
                    Life expectancy is a significant factor in estimating the size of the world’s populations over time.
                    Groups with higher life expectancies will, on average, live longer and (all else remaining equal)
                    have larger populations. A higher share of young people who are alive today in Europe and North
                    America are likely to be alive in 2050 compared with those residing in sub-Saharan Africa and the
                    Asia-Pacific region.</p><br>

                <p  class="indent">In the decades ahead, the world’s population will increase as people live longer. From 1950 until

                    of the population was 28 years. And by 2050, the global median age is expected to be 37, as
                    declining
                    fertility rates lead to relative stability in the number of young children and as the elderly
                    population
                    soars. The United Nations estimates that the number of people ages 100 and older will rise from
                    about
                    150,000 in the year 2000 to more than 3 million in 2050.</p><br>


                <p>
                    A simple way to look at the age structure of the world’s population is to divide everyone into three
                    age
                    groups – children younger than 15, teens and adults between ages 15 and 59 and adults ages 60 and
                    older.

                    As of 2010, the largest group was the middle category (62%), and there were many more children (27%)
                    than older adults (11%). But as the global population ages, this distribution will shift,
                    particularly
                    among the youngest and oldest cohorts. By 2050, according to U.N. projections, the share of people
                    ages
                    <img src="https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/04/PF_15.04.02_ch1graphics_ageWorld310px.png" height="250px" class="float">
                    60 and older (22%) will exceed the share under age 15 (20%).The youthfulness of a population is an
                    important factor in future growth. All else being equal, a population that begins with a relatively
                    large percentage of people who are in – or soon will enter – their prime childbearing years will
                    grow

                    faster than a population that begins with many people who are beyond their prime reproductive years.
                    Moreover, growth propelled by a youthful population tends to carry into the next generation, as the
                    younger cohort’s children reach maturity and begin to have babies of their own, creating a kind of
                    demographic momentum.

                    Among the world’s major religious groups, Muslims had the highest concentration of children as of
                    2010
                    (34% of Muslims worldwide were under the age of 15), while Jews had the highest concentration of
                    older
                    adults (20% of Jews worldwide were 60 or older in 2010).</p><br>

                    Globally, fewer than one-in-five religiously unaffiliated people (19%) were under the age of 15, the
                    smallest share of children in any of the major religious groups in 2010. This reflects the
                    geographic
                    concentration of the unaffiliated in countries such as China and Japan, which have relatively old
                    populations with low fertility rates.

                <p>For similar reasons, Buddhists also are an older population, with just 20% under age 15. By contrast,
                    more than a quarter of Christians worldwide and three-in-ten Hindus were in the youngest age group
                    as of
                    2010. This reflects the high fertility rates in recent decades among Christians in sub-Saharan
                    Africa
                    and Hindus in India.</p><br>

                <p>For the purposes of projecting future growth, the number of women in their early reproductive years
                    also
                    is a key factor. As of 2010, 13% of the world’s population consisted of females between the ages of
                    15
                    and 29. Muslims were the only major religious group with a higher share of women in this category
                    (14%)
                    than the global average, yet another reason the Muslim population is poised for rapid growth in the
                    coming decades. The religiously unaffiliated (11%) and Jews (10%) had the lowest shares of women
                    ages
                    15-29 in their populations, as of 2010.</p>
                <h2>4.Migration</h2>
                <p  class="indent">International migration has no immediate impact on the global size of religious groups. But, over
                    time,
                    migration can significantly change the religious makeup of individual countries and even entire
                    regions.
                    Europe, for example, has experienced an inflow of Muslims from North Africa, South Asia and Turkey
                    over
                    the past decade. And some of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, such as Qatar and the United Arab
                    Emirates, have had substantial immigration of non-Muslims from Asia and beyond.</p><br>

                <p>Religious Composition of Projected International Migration Flows Between 2010 and 2015
                    Estimating future migration is challenging because the movement of people across borders is
                    dependent on
                    government policies and international events that can change quickly. And because many migrants
                    follow
                    economic opportunities, migration patterns also are dependent on changing economic conditions.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Nonetheless, it is possible to use data on past migration as a reasonable estimate for the future,
                    just
                    as past fertility and religious switching patterns are used in this report to model future fertility
                    and
                    switching.</p><br>

                <p>The Pew Research Center, in collaboration with researchers at the International Institute for Applied
                    Systems Analysis, has developed an innovative technique to estimate recent migration patterns and
                    their
                    religious breakdown. First, recent changes in the origins and destinations of migrants worldwide are
                    estimated using census and survey data about the migrant population living in each country. Changes
                    in
                    this migrant “stock” data over the 2005 to 2010 period are used to estimate migrant “flows,” the
                    number
                    of people who moved between countries during this period, taking into account the slowing of
                    migration
                    in many parts of the world due to an economic downturn.32 Second, religious breakdowns of migrants
                    based
                    on data from the Pew Research Center’s Global Religion and Migration Database are applied to the
                    origins
                    and destinations of migrants. Finally, the religious breakdown of migrant flows is used to calculate
                    migration rates into and out of most countries by religion, by sex and by five-year age groups</p>

                </em>
                <p  class="indent">The "population growth rate" is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases
                    in
                    a given time period, expressed as a fraction of the initial population. Specifically, population
                    growth
                    rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period, often expressed as a percentage of
                    the
                    number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period. This can be written as the
                    formula, valid for a sufficiently small time interval</p><br>

                <p>A positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing, while a negative growth rate
                    indicates that the population is decreasing. A growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the
                    same
                    number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when
                    there
                    are significant changes in the birth rates, death rates, immigration rates, and age distribution
                    between
                    the two times.</p><br>

                <p>A related measure is the net reproduction rate. In the absence of migration, a net reproduction rate
                    of
                    more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing, while a net reproduction rate
                    less
                    than one (sub-replacement fertility) indicates that the population of females is decreasing.</p><br>

                <p>Most populations do not grow exponentially, rather they follow a logistic model. Once the population
                    has
                    reached its carrying capacity, it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards
                    the
                    carrying capacity, which is usually when a population has depleted most its natural resources.[27]
                    In
                    the world human population, growth may be said to have been following a linear trend throughout the
                    last

                <p  class="indent">We are living in an era of unprecedented population growth.
                    Since the middle of the twentieth century, the world’s
                    population has more than tripled in size, reaching almost
                    8 billion people in 2022 (figure 1). Projections by the United
                    Nations suggest that the size of the global population could
                    grow to almost 11 billion by around 2100. However, the pace of
                    global growth has slowed considerably since around 1970, and
                    the world’s population is expected to stabilize by the end of the
                    century. </p>

                <p>The unprecedented growth of the global population that has
                    occurred since 1950 is the result of two trends: on the one
                    hand, the gradual increase in average human longevity due to
                    widespread improvements in public health, nutrition, personal
                    hygiene and medicine, and on the other hand, the persistence of
                    high levels of fertility in many countries.</p>
                <P>The world’s poorest countries have some of the
                    fastest growing populations: the population
                    of low-income countries, located mostly in
                    sub-Saharan Africa, is projected almost to double
                    in size between 2020 and 2050, accounting for
                    most of the global increase expected by the end
                    of the century</P><br>
                <h2>POPULATION GROWTH IS BOTH A
                    CAUSE AND A SYMPTOM OF SLOW
                    PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p  class="indent">Sustained, rapid population growth adds to
                    the challenge of achieving social and economic
                    development and magnifies the scale of the
                    investments and effort required to ensure that no
                    one is left behind.</p>
                <p>Rapid population growth makes it more difficult
                    for low-income and lower-middle-income
                    countries to afford the increase in public
                    expenditures on a per capita basis that is needed to
                    eradicate poverty, end hunger and malnutrition,
                    and ensure universal access to health care,
                    education and other essential services.</p>
                <p>Lack of autonomy and opportunity among women
                    and girls can contribute to high fertility and rapid
                    population growth. Achieving the Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda
                    for Sustainable Development, especially targets
                    related to reproductive health, education and
                    gender equality, requires empowering individuals
                    to make informed choices.</p>
                <p>Today, millions of people around the globe,
                    mostly in low-income and lower-middle-income
                    countries, lack access to the information and
                    services needed to determine whether and when
                    to have children. In general, women with higher
                    levels of education tend to have greater autonomy
                    to make these decisions compared to women with
                    no education living in the same country (figure 2).
                    Ensuring that individuals, in particular women,
                    have the ability to decide the number of children
                    that they will have and the timing of their
                    births can markedly improve well-being and help to disrupt
                    intergenerational cycles of poverty. Increased access to highquality reproductive health-care
                    services, including for safe
                    and effective methods of family planning, could help reduce
                    fertility and accelerate economic and social development.</p><br>

                <u><h2>Conclusion:</h2></u>
                <p class="indent">The global phenomenon of population growth has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate,
                    spanning across disciplines ranging from sociology and economics to environmental science and public
                    health. As we conclude this exploration of population growth, it is imperative to reflect on the
                    multifaceted implications, challenges, and potential solutions associated with the burgeoning
                    numbers of inhabitants on our planet.</p>

                    <p>One of the most glaring consequences of rapid population growth is the strain it places on essential
                    resources. The demand for food, water, energy, and living space has intensified, leading to issues
                    such as deforestation, water scarcity, and the depletion of natural resources. As the global
                    population continues to expand, it becomes increasingly crucial to develop sustainable practices
                    that ensure the equitable distribution of resources and mitigate the environmental impact of human
                    activities.</p><br>

                    <p>Moreover, population growth is intricately linked to socioeconomic factors, with the potential to
                    exacerbate existing inequalities. In many regions, high population growth rates coincide with
                    poverty, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. Breaking this cycle requires
                    concerted efforts to address the root causes of population growth, including promoting education,
                    empowering women, and implementing effective family planning programs.</p>

                    <p>The demographic shift towards an aging population in some parts of the world presents another facet
                    of the population growth conundrum. This trend poses challenges to healthcare systems, pension
                    schemes, and intergenerational equity. Policymakers must grapple with innovative solutions to adapt
                    to this demographic shift, fostering inclusivity and creating policies that support the well-being
                    of both younger and older generations.</p><br>

                    <P>Furthermore, the global interconnectedness facilitated by technology and trade has implications for
                    how we perceive and address population growth. Solutions must be collaborative and transcend
                    national borders, recognizing the shared responsibility of all nations to address the challenges
                    posed by population growth. International cooperation is crucial in developing and implementing
                    effective strategies that balance the needs of growing populations with the imperative of
                    sustainable development.</P><br>

                    <p>In conclusion, the issue of population growth is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires
                    a holistic and nuanced approach. It demands the collaboration of governments, communities, and
                    individuals to address the various interconnected aspects, from environmental sustainability and
                    resource management to social equality and healthcare. As we navigate the future, mindful and
                    informed decision-making will be essential to foster a world where population growth aligns with the
                    principles of equity, sustainability, and human flourishing.</p>
